<!--Here's where you talk about yourself-->
		<p>Greetings, everyone! My name is Bridget Bourne. I am 25 years old, and am a graduate from the University of Dallas with a B.A. in Classics. As a result, I am highly skilled in the studies of literature and languages, especially Latin and to a lesser extent, Ancient Greek. However, before I decided to major in Classics, I had been majoring in mathematics for 2 years, and am thus extremely apt in the field of applied mathematics. I now am aspiring to teach Latin, mathematics, and/or music, preferrably to high school students.</p>
		<p>In addition to my search for a job in the education field, I recently have also started to learn how to code computers at the University of Central Florida's coding bootcamp. Before I was residing in Florida, I had been living in Denver, Colorado for about 8 years, and moved down here only a month ago. Although the coding work is considerably difficult, my skills with the subject are becoming better and better each day.</p></div>
